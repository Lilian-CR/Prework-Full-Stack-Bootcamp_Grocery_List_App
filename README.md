## Process
-	I watchwed the FreeCodeCamp Youtube tutorial to layout out my html, js and css. 
Set up the JavaScript file, selecting items from the html doc, setting up our variables and creating classes to store the numbers that would be used. 
-  Next was added event listeners and functions for when a button is clicked, such as the rubbish icon, submit button, etc. 
-	Defined the javascript functions as adding items, displaying alerts when the text field is clicked wheil empty, for removing items, functions to edit items, clear items and delete.
-	Added a local storage to keep track of the items as well as to revert to a default state when cleared.
- Added design elements made with canva.com for the background image and new font colours and shadows.
